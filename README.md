# Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccinations
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of individuals receiving H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccinations using data-driven insights from behavioral, social, and economic factors. Leveraging the dataset provided by the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey, the solution implements machine learning models like Random Forest, KNeighbors, and Neural Networks to achieve up to 85.32% ROC AUC. Key steps include robust data preprocessing, feature encoding, and experimentation with hyperparameters for optimal model performance.

# Features:
Dataset: [Utilized the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/page/213/) with 35 features on demographic, behavioral, and economic factors 
Preprocessing: Handled missing data using SimpleImputer and encoded categorical variables using OneHotEncoder.
Models: Implemented Random Forest, KNeighbors, and Neural Networks with comparative analysis of results.
Achievements: Achieved 85.32% ROC AUC with Random Forest and explored challenges with Neural Networks.
Future Work: Suggested improvements include trying CatBoost and Convolutional Neural Networks.
